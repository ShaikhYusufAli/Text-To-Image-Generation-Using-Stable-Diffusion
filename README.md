# Text-To-Image-Generation-Using-Stable-Diffusion
This project is intended to show the capability of Stable Diffusion, an advanced deep learning model designed for the sole intent of creating high-quality images based on user-supplied textual descriptions. The project entails several crucial steps, such as the development of a Python programming environment that is best suited for such an endeavor, the installation of all the libraries needed that will assist the process, the development of a comprehensive script that appropriately processes the text prompts supplied, and lastly, the development of images that are based on artificial intelligence techniques.

# Challenges Faced
   
1. Library Installation Issues:
   
Some dependencies (torch, torchvision, diffusers) required large file downloads.
Version mismatches caused installation failures.
âœ… Solution: Installed correct versions and ensured Python compatibility.

3. CUDA/GPU Availability Issues:
   
Running on a CPU was extremely slow, requiring GPU acceleration.
Systems without CUDA support had long processing times.
âœ… Solution: Implemented a check for CUDA availability and optimized processing for CPU users.

4. Model Loading Errors:
   
The Stable Diffusion model had version conflicts and missing dependencies.
âœ… Solution: Installed correct versions and handled errors using proper exception handling.

5. Image Not Matching the Prompt:
   
Issue: The generated image sometimes does not match the given text prompt.
âœ… Solution:
Increased guidance_scale to 8-10 for more prompt accuracy.
Increased num_inference_steps for better image clarity.
Experimented with different prompt structures for more accurate outputs.

6. High Memory Consumption:
   
The model required high VRAM (GPU memory), causing crashes on low-end systems.
âœ… Solution: Reduced inference steps and used lower-resolution image settings.

# Outputs and Result
   
 Generated Image Example:
Below is an example of an AI-generated image based on a text prompt:
Prompt: "A girl having an apple"
